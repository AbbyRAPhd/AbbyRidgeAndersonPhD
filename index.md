title: Hope is a green eyeliner pencil
---
Once upon a time, two 14 year old girls met each other during their first weekend at boarding school. They were both pretty weird, and they became best friends almost immediately; although it would take both of them years to figure out that weird is just a side effect of being awesome. Despite the inherent awkwardness & social insecurities of early adolescence, they didn't mind, and actually enjoyed, being weird together. 

One of those girls was me; the other was my best friend Charlene. Charlene died by suicide in June 2004, 6 days after her 24th birthday. 

I spent the summer of 2004 in a black well of grief, guilt, anger, confusion, regret, and despair. But on one beautiful morning in July of that summer, I woke up feeling strangely lighter and brighter. It had been so long since I'd felt hope that I didn't recognize it; I hadn't even realized it had been missing. It was like those Claritin commercials where you see a person walking through a field on a sunny day, and then a film appears to be peeled away from your tv screen, and everything suddenly becomes 10 times clearer - the green of the grass and the blue of the sky are much more vivid, the picture is crisp and clear; and it's not until that moment that you realize the world had been fuzzy and dull before the film was peeled away.

I felt hope, that morning. And so I had just enough energy to go with my husband to the grocery store. On a whim, I decided to put on green eyeliner before we left. And as I looked at myself in the mirror that day, I realized that I was still ME. I hadn't completely drowned in the black well - there was still a confident, cool, weird, awesome ME inside, and I could be that self again. 

It took me more than a year to be free of the black well of grief on more days than not, and several more years to fully come back to myself. But my process of recovery began on that morning in July, when I held that green eyeliner pencil and looked in the mirror and felt that first glimmer of hope that I could still be my best self, despite losing Charlene. 

It's been almost 30 years since the day I met my best friend, and on June 18th of this year it will have been 19 years since the day I lost her. I still miss Charlene. And I still wear green eyeliner whenever I need to remember that I AM the weird cool confident woman that she helped me become.  I still wear green eyeliner whenever I need to remember that there is always hope.
